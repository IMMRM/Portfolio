                     When we start our journey in machine learning, we come across multiple simple algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression etc.
                    Among them one of the simplest algorithms is K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN for short). I really like this algorithm due to its simplicity and ease of understanding as it very much aligns itself to the real world. In this article, we're going to understand what KNN is, how it works and its applications in the easiest way possible.
